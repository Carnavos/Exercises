Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array as an argument, and returns a new array that is sorted. Review the following URL for help sorting numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array, and returns a new array that contains elements in the array you passed in that are larger than 25.
In your HTML, create one input field of type text and one <button> element.
Attach an event handler to the button click with jQuery.
Type in a comma-delimited list of integers into that input field (e.g. 10,3,5,67,22).
When the button is clicked retrieve the value of the input field.
Convert that string of comma-delimited numbers into an array.
Pass that array into the function that finds numbers higher than 25. Remember how to convert strings to numbers?
The array that is the result of that, pass it into the function that sorts the array.
Loop over the sorted array and create a DOM string that wraps a
element around each number (e.g. output += something).
Give each <div> a class of "number".
Write a CSS class that changes the font color of the even elements to red.
Write a CSS class that changes the background color of the odd elements to azure.
